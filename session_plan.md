# Chat Backend Integration Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan details the step-by-step process to connect the frontend chat interface with the backend API. The focus is on establishing reliable communication between the React frontend and FastAPI backend while properly handling authentication, queue management, and conversation data.

## Current Status

- Frontend: React/TypeScript with modular chat service implementation
- Backend: FastAPI with authenticated endpoints and RabbitMQ queue integration
- Authentication: JWT-based auth system implemented on both sides
- Integration progress: Chat service connected with WebSocket streaming and message status tracking

## Remaining Issues

- Session management: Authentication now persists better between tabs/refreshes ✅
- Conversation history: Fixed issues with random new conversations being created unexpectedly ✅
- Admin dashboard: Queue information not accurate, cards not updating properly
- Error handling: Improved error handling and centralized patterns ✅
- Communication: Implemented WebSocket streaming for LLM responses ✅
- Database transactions: Fixed transaction conflicts in async operations ✅

## Implementation Goals

1. Connect frontend chat UI to backend API endpoints ✅
2. Implement proper error handling and loading states ✅
3. Add conversation history management ✅
4. Support file uploads
5. Handle queue timeouts gracefully ✅
6. Consolidate error handling logic ✅
7. Implement WebSocket integration for real-time updates ✅
