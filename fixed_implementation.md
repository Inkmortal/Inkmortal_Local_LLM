# Fixed Implementation Summary

## Fixed Bugs:

1. **Error in rabbitmq/manager.py**:
   - Added proper `get_position` method to the RabbitMQManager class
   - Fixed position calculation to work with the priority queue system
   - Made sure it correctly integrates with the get_queue_size method

2. **Import Paths**:
   - Updated `main.py` to import from the correct modules
   - Fixed `check_admin_exists` and `generate_setup_token` imports
   - Updated `__all__` exports in the router files

3. **Cross-Tab Authentication**:
   - Verified BroadcastChannel for multi-tab support
   - Confirmed localStorage and cookie usage with 14-day expiration
   - UI notifications properly formatted and integrated

## Key Files Modified:

1. `/backend/app/queue/rabbitmq/manager.py`:
   - Added the `get_position` method to provide queue position tracking
   - Position calculation takes priority levels into account
   - Logic handles the edge case of a request currently being processed

2. `/backend/app/main.py`:
   - Updated imports to use the modular auth system
   - Fixed function imports from login router

3. `/backend/app/auth/login/__init__.py`:
   - Ensured exported functions are properly available
   - Added correct `__all__` list

## How to Test:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Verify that user logins persist across multiple tabs
3. Test queue position tracking when submitting chat messages
4. Check error handling when server is unavailable

## Notes:

- The queue position is an estimation due to how RabbitMQ works
- Error handling shows user-friendly messages for all network issues
- Authentication state synchronizes between tabs in real-time
