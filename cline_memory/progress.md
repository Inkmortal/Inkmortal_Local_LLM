    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
- Detailed implementation plans created for all system components:
    - `01_core_infrastructure.md` - Base system setup and project structure (Completed)
    - `02_ollama_integration.md` - LLM server integration and queue system (Implemented)
    - `03_authentication.md` - User authentication and access control (Implemented)
    - `04_api_gateway.md` - API routing and request handling (Implemented)
    - `05_web_interface.md` - Chat interface implementation
    - `06_admin_panel.md` - Administration interface
    - `07_monitoring.md` - System monitoring and logging
- Documentation review and enhancement:
    - Updated `projectbrief.md` with educational focus and personal project context.
    - Enhanced `activeContext.md` with implementation plan rationale and initial setup completion.
    - Updated `05_web_interface.md` with educational features (math rendering, code highlighting, image uploads).
    - Established code organization principle of keeping files under 400 lines.
    - Updated `techContext.md` with pyenv instructions and additional dependencies.
- Created basic files for backend and frontend:
    - `backend/app/main.py` (FastAPI entry point)
    - `frontend/src/App.tsx` (Basic React component)
    - `frontend/public/index.html`
    - `frontend/src/index.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/index.css` (with theme support)
    - `frontend/src/App.css`
    - `frontend/package.json`
    - `frontend/tsconfig.json`
    - `frontend/tsconfig.node.json`
    - `frontend/vite.config.ts`

- Implemented core backend components:
    - Database configuration with SQLAlchemy
    - User authentication system with JWT tokens
    - Registration token management for invitation-based registration
    - API key management for custom applications
    - API Gateway for routing requests to Ollama
    - Priority-based queue system with request aging to prevent starvation
- Enhanced setup script:
    - Added PostgreSQL detection
    - Added environment configuration (.env files)
    - Added SQLite fallback option for development
    - Improved setup instructions

## In Progress
- Setting up the development environment (Python virtual environment, Node.js dependencies).
- Preparing to implement the Admin Panel.

## To Do
- Implement Admin Panel for system management.
- Implement Web Interface for chat functionality.
- Implement educational features in the web interface:
    - Math rendering with LaTeX support
    - Code highlighting and formatting
    - Image upload for textbook questions
    - Beautiful and functional UI focused on learning
- Test each component individually and as an integrated system.
- Deploy the system to the Mac Mini M4 Pro.
- Configure Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote access.
- Implement system monitoring and logging.

## Issues
- None at this time.
