## Chat Interface

-   [x] Basic UI implementation.
-   [x] Math rendering (frontend).
-   [x] Code highlighting (frontend).
-   [ ] Connect to backend API:
    -   [ ] Replace mock chat service with actual API calls.
    -   [ ] Implement streaming responses.
    -   [ ] Add error handling for API failures.
    -   [ ] Implement user session persistence.
    -   [ ] Integrate backend artifact rendering.
-   [ ] Implement remaining features:
    -   [ ] Image upload for textbook questions.

## Conversation History and Context

-   [ ] Design data model for conversation history.
-   [ ] Implement mechanisms for retrieving and updating conversation history.
-   [ ] Develop strategy for managing context windows:
    -   [ ] Conversation summarization.
    -   [ ] Backend RAG solution for important entities.
    -   [ ] Ability to update notes on important entities.
-   [ ] Implement embeddings.

## LLM Tool Use

-   [ ] Research how to integrate tools with Ollama and the chosen LLM.
-   [ ] Determine how to represent tools in the chat interface.
-   [ ] Implement API endpoints and backend logic for tool use.

## LangChain Integration

-   [ ] Document existing API endpoints (especially `/api/chat/completions`).
-   [ ] Provide instructions on using the API key and custom endpoint with LangChain.

## Admin Panel
- [x] Connect dashboard to real backend data

## Testing

-   [ ] Test each component individually.
-   [ ] Test the system as an integrated whole.

## Deployment

-   [ ] Deploy the system to the Mac Mini M4 Pro.
-   [ ] Configure Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote access.

## Monitoring

-   [ ] Implement system monitoring and logging.

## Frontend

- [ ] Address routing refactor issues
    -   [ ] Replace all uses of `window.navigateTo` with React Router's `useNavigate` hook
    -   [ ] Standardize navigation methods across all components
    -   [ ] Ensure consistent API response handling in Login.tsx and all components
    -   [ ] Verify all component imports in routes.tsx
    -   [ ] Standardize route constant usage throughout the application
