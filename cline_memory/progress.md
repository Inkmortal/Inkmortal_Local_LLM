# Project Progress

## Completed
- Initial project setup and directory structure.
- Memory bank established with core documents:
    - `memoryRegistry.md`
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md`
- Detailed implementation plans created for all system components:
    - `01_core_infrastructure.md` - Base system setup and project structure
    - `02_ollama_integration.md` - LLM server integration and queue system
    - `03_authentication.md` - User authentication and access control
    - `04_api_gateway.md` - API routing and request handling
    - `05_web_interface.md` - Chat interface implementation
    - `06_admin_panel.md` - Administration interface
    - `07_monitoring.md` - System monitoring and logging
- Documentation review and enhancement:
    - Updated `projectbrief.md` with educational focus and personal project context
    - Enhanced `activeContext.md` with implementation plan rationale
    - Updated `05_web_interface.md` with educational features (math rendering, code highlighting, image uploads)
    - Established code organization principle of keeping files under 400 lines

## In Progress
- Setting up the development environment.
- Beginning implementation of core infrastructure.

## To Do
- Implement all system components according to the implementation plans.
- Test each component individually and as an integrated system.
- Deploy the system to the Mac Mini M4 Pro.
- Configure Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote access.
- Implement educational features in the web interface:
    - Math rendering with LaTeX support
    - Code highlighting and formatting
    - Image upload for textbook questions
    - Beautiful and functional UI focused on learning

## Issues
- None at this time.

## Next Documentation Updates
- Review implementation documents for code organization (ensure under 400 lines)
- Add specific educational use cases to web interface documentation
- Create initial design mockups for the chat interface
