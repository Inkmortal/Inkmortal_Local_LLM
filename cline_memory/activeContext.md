# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing core system components.
- Setting up the authentication system.
- Implementing the API Gateway and queue management.
- Optimizing RabbitMQ implementation for production use.

## Implementation Plan Rationale
The implementation order begins with authentication components and API Gateway because they are prerequisites for testing and managing other parts of the system. This approach allows us to:
- Generate authentication tokens needed for testing other components
- Establish a management interface early in development
- Build core API endpoints progressively
- Implement priority-based queue management for LLM requests

## Code Organization Principles
- All code files must stay under 300 lines (changed from 400)
- Large files should be refactored into smaller components
- Use modular architecture to maintain clarity and maintainability
- Delegate specific responsibilities to appropriate components

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue with detailed implementation of each major component in the `implementation/` directory, following this order:
    - `01_core_infrastructure.md`: Base system setup, project structure, and initial deployment scripts. (**Completed**)
    - `03_authentication.md`: Implementing user registration, authentication, and authorization. (**Implemented**)
    - `04_api_gateway.md`: Configuring the API gateway, routing, and request handling. (**Implemented**)
    - `02_ollama_integration.md`: Setting up Ollama, creating the proxy service, and implementing the queue manager. (**Implemented and Optimized**)
    - `06_admin_panel.md`: Creating the React-based administration panel. (Next priority)
    - `05_web_interface.md`: Building the React-based chat interface with educational features.
    - `07_monitoring.md`: Implementing system monitoring, logging, and usage tracking.

2. Test the refactored RabbitMQ queue implementation in production:
    - Monitor queue performance and stability
    - Verify message aging and priority handling
    - Test under various load conditions

3. Implement the Admin Panel with queue monitoring features:
    - Dashboard for queue statistics
    - Controls for clearing and managing the queue
    - User and API key management UI

## Web Interface Educational Focus
The web interface should emphasize educational assistant capabilities:
- Math problem solving with LaTeX rendering
- Code teaching and assistance with syntax highlighting
- Textbook question support with image upload
- User-friendly, beautiful, and functional design

## Key Decisions
- Using a microservices architecture with a central API gateway.
- Implementing a priority-based queue system with request aging to prevent starvation.
- Using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.
- Using Ollama for LLM serving, now updated to use Llama 3.3 70B model.
- Using RabbitMQ for reliable queue management with component-based architecture.
- Using Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote access.
- Prioritizing Admin Panel implementation, with necessary authentication and API support.
- Designing the system as a hobby project focused on personal educational use.
- Chaycards application will connect as a client via API rather than direct integration.

## Recent Progress
- Implemented the authentication system with JWT tokens and registration token management
- Implemented the API Gateway with Ollama proxy functionality
- Implemented a priority-based queue manager with request aging to prevent starvation
- Created database models for users, registration tokens, and API keys
- Updated setup script to include PostgreSQL detection and environment configuration
- Refactored RabbitMQ implementation into smaller, more maintainable components with improved reliability
- Updated to use Llama 3.3 model instead of Llama 3
- Fixed critical issues in the queue testing environment:
  - Resolved double-promotion bug in request aging logic
  - Improved error handling and statistics tracking in queue managers
  - Enhanced test reliability with more robust assertions
  - Fixed interface abstraction to ensure proper implementation in both queue managers
  - Added comprehensive debugging to help identify queue state issues

## Open Questions
- Specific details of the admin panel UI design
- Fine-tuning of Nginx configuration
- Detailed design of the monitoring dashboards
- Most effective prompting techniques for educational use cases
- Long-term queue performance monitoring strategy
