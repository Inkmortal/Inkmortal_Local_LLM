# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Fine-tuning the authentication system and ensuring proper route protection.
- Expanding and enhancing the chat interface features.
- Connecting the chat interface to the backend API services.
- Completing the admin panel implementation with real backend data.

## Implementation Plan Rationale
The implementation order begins with authentication components and API Gateway because they are prerequisites for testing and managing other parts of the system. This approach allows us to:
- Generate authentication tokens needed for testing other components
- Establish a management interface early in development
- Build core API endpoints progressively
- Implement priority-based queue management for LLM requests

## Code Organization Principles
- All code files must stay under 300 lines (changed from 400)
- Large files should be refactored into smaller components
- Use modular architecture to maintain clarity and maintainability
- Delegate specific responsibilities to appropriate components

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue with detailed implementation of each major component in the `implementation/` directory, following this order:
    - `01_core_infrastructure.md`: Base system setup, project structure, and initial deployment scripts. (**Completed**)
    - `03_authentication.md`: Implementing user registration, authentication, and authorization. (**Implemented**)
    - `04_api_gateway.md`: Configuring the API gateway, routing, and request handling. (**Implemented**)
    - `02_ollama_integration.md`: Setting up Ollama, creating the proxy service, and implementing the queue manager. (**Implemented and Optimized**)
    - `06_admin_panel.md`: Creating the React-based administration panel. (In Progress)
    - `05_web_interface.md`: Building the React-based chat interface with educational features. (Partially Implemented)
    - `07_monitoring.md`: Implementing system monitoring, logging, and usage tracking.

2. Connect chat interface to real backend API:
    - Replace mock chat service with actual API calls
    - Implement streaming responses for chat messages
    - Add error handling for API failures
    - Implement user session persistence

3. Complete the Admin Panel:
    - Connect dashboard to real backend data
    - Finish implementing user management features
    - Complete registration token and API key management interfaces
    - Implement real-time queue monitoring and control

## Web Interface Educational Focus
The web interface should emphasize educational assistant capabilities:
- Math problem solving with LaTeX rendering (Implemented)
- Code teaching and assistance with syntax highlighting (Implemented)
- Textbook question support with image upload (Planned)
- User-friendly, beautiful, and functional design (In Progress)

## Key Decisions
- Using a microservices architecture with a central API gateway.
- Implementing a priority-based queue system with request aging to prevent starvation.
- Using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.
- Using Ollama for LLM serving, now updated to use Llama 3.3 70B model.
- Using RabbitMQ for reliable queue management with component-based architecture.
- Using Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote access.
- Prioritizing Admin Panel implementation, with necessary authentication and API support.
- Designing the system as a hobby project focused on personal educational use.
- Chaycards application will connect as a client via API rather than direct integration.

## Previous Progress
- Implemented the authentication system with JWT tokens and registration token management
- Implemented the API Gateway with Ollama proxy functionality
- Implemented a priority-based queue manager with request aging to prevent starvation
- Created database models for users, registration tokens, and API keys
- Updated setup script to include PostgreSQL detection and environment configuration
- Refactored RabbitMQ implementation into smaller, more maintainable components with improved reliability
- Updated to use Llama 3.3 model instead of Llama 3
- Fixed critical issues in the queue testing environment:
  - Resolved double-promotion bug in request aging logic
  - Improved error handling and statistics tracking in queue managers
  - Enhanced test reliability with more robust assertions
  - Fixed interface abstraction to ensure proper implementation in both queue managers
  - Added comprehensive debugging to help identify queue state issues
- Fixed admin panel connectivity and user experience issues:
  - Created a proper API configuration module to ensure correct backend connectivity
  - Added explicit error handling for API connection failures
  - Fixed routing inconsistencies for the theme customizer component
  - Improved admin login UX with better button placement
