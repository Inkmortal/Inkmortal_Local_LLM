# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Establishing the core project structure and documentation.
- Defining the initial implementation plan.
- Setting up the development environment.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create detailed implementation documents for each major component in the `implementation/` directory, and begin implementation in this order:
    - `01_core_infrastructure.md`: Base system setup, project structure, and initial deployment scripts.
    - `03_authentication.md`: Implementing user registration, authentication, and authorization. (Basic authentication for Admin Panel first)
    - `04_api_gateway.md`: Configuring the API gateway, routing, and request handling. (Partial implementation initially to support Admin Panel, then full implementation)
    - `06_admin_panel.md`: Creating the React-based administration panel. (Prioritized, requires basic authentication and API endpoints)
    - `04_api_gateway.md`: (Continued) Full API Gateway implementation.
    - `02_ollama_integration.md`: Setting up Ollama, creating the proxy service, and implementing the queue manager.
    - `05_web_interface.md`: Building the React-based chat interface.
    - `07_monitoring.md`: Implementing system monitoring, logging, and usage tracking.

## Key Decisions
- Using a microservices architecture with a central API gateway.
- Implementing a priority-based queue system.
- Using FastAPI for the backend and React for the frontend.
- Using Ollama for LLM serving.
- Using Cloudflare Tunnel for secure remote access.
- Prioritizing Admin Panel implementation, with necessary authentication and API support.

## Open Questions
- Specific details of the queue management algorithm.
- Fine-tuning of Nginx configuration.
- Detailed design of the monitoring dashboards.
