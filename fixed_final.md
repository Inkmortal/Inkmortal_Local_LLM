# Final Fixes Summary

## Key Fixes:

1. **Router Prefix Issue:**
   - Removed `/auth` prefix from sub-routers
   - Main router will now correctly map endpoints like `/auth/admin/login`

2. **RabbitMQ Queue Position Tracking:**
   - Implemented the `get_position` method that:
     - Returns 0 if current request
     - Examines all higher priority queues
     - Estimates position based on queue size

3. **Login Session Persistence:**
   - 14-day token expiration in backend
   - LocalStorage + cookies for persistence
   - BroadcastChannel for cross-tab synchronization 

## Root Cause:

The 404 errors were caused by the sub-routers having their own `/auth` prefix, which when combined with the parent router's prefix resulted in URLs like `/auth/auth/admin/login` instead of `/auth/admin/login`.

Each sub-router should NOT include the parent prefix, as FastAPI combines these paths. The imports for the admin setup functions were also fixed to use the relocated functions.

## Testing Instructions:

Test the authentication by:
1. Verifying admin login works and shows the dashboard
2. Opening multiple tabs and checking that login persists
3. Submitting chat messages and monitoring queue position
4. Confirming that completed requests appear in history

If any issues remain, review the backend stdout logs for specific error messages.

## Configuration Overview:

- Token expiration: 14 days
- Queue position: Calculated based on priority level
- Error notifications: User-friendly with consistent formatting
- Cross-tab auth: Real-time synchronization via BroadcastChannel

All changes maintain compatibility with the existing architecture while ensuring code files remain under 400 lines.
